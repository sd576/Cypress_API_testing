# Cypress API Testing

A series of API tests written in Cypress.io for demonstration purposes of how quickly API tests run.

These tests use the API: [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com), which is a Fake store REST API for your e-commerce or shopping website prototype.

## Getting Started

To run this on your computer, follow these steps:

1. **Create a folder**: Create a folder where you wish to clone the repo to and name it `Cypress_API_testing`.

2. **Navigate to the folder**: Open your terminal and navigate to that folder using the command:

    ```
    cd Cypress_API_testing
    ```

3. **Clone the repository**: Clone the repository using the following command:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/sd576/Cypress_API_testing.git
    ```

4. **Install dependencies**: Install the dependencies by running the command:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

5. **Run Cypress**: To run Cypress, execute the following command:

    ```
    npx cypress open
    ```

This will open Cypress, and you'll be able to see and run the API tests.

Feel free to modify or extend these tests for your own use cases!
